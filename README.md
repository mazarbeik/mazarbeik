## 🎓 About Me

I'm a **Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science (Informatics)** at **TU Wien** and a researcher at the **Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Digital Health and Patient Safety** and **Medical University of Vienna**. My work bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI and critical healthcare applications, focusing on decision support systems that can save lives in intensive care settings.

With a background spanning mechanical engineering to computer science, I bring a unique interdisciplinary perspective to solving complex problems in AI and robotics.

## 🔬 Research Interests

- **🧠 Reinforcement Learning**: Developing algorithms for sequential decision-making in uncertain environments
- **🏥 Clinical Decision Support**: Applying ML to optimize treatment timing and patient outcomes in intensive care
- **🤖 Generative AI & LLMs**: Exploring hallucination detection and advanced language model applications
- **📍 Robotics**: State estimation, sensor fusion, and localization using Kalman filtering techniques

## 🎯 Current Focus

I'm currently working on **reinforcement learning algorithms for optimal timing of medical interventions** in critically ill patients, particularly focusing on renal replacement therapy. This work combines deep learning, clinical data analysis, and decision theory to improve patient outcomes.

## 📚 Selected Publications

- **Optimal timing for renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients using reinforcement learning algorithms** | *Journal of Critical Care* (2025)
- **Augmenting inertial motion capture with SLAM using EKF and SRUKF data fusion algorithms** | *Measurement* (2023)
- **TU Wien at SemEval-2024 task 6: Unifying model-agnostic and model-aware techniques for hallucination detection** | *SemEval-2024*
